 * app - the contract between the shell and the things it launches.
 *
 * "Apps" here are not processes. There is one binary, one address space and
 * one core; an app is a set of callbacks the shell drives. That keeps
 * switching instant and costs no flash partitions, at the price of apps not
 * being isolated from each other - a misbehaving app can corrupt the shell.
 *
 * An app never owns the screen or the frame loop. It draws into the shared
 * framebuffer when asked and returns; the shell decides when to present, and
 * paints its own chrome on top afterwards.
