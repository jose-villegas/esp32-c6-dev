/* A lattice of glass-walled compartments - 20 columns by 24 rows, 480 in
 * all - each one a ring of glass around a single payload, with a shatter
 * trigger sitting just outside the ring rather than inside it. Every other
 * thermal-shock test in this file places one pane at a chosen temperature
 * and drops one cold or hot thing next to it; this scene exists to ask
 * what the mechanism does at the scale the pour brush can actually
 * produce, with hundreds of panes cracking, draining and re-heating at
 * once instead of one.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT THAT MAKES THE SCENE HONEST: every ring is painted at
 * variant 2, 3 or 4 - strictly between SAND_SHOCK_COLD (1) and
 * SAND_SHOCK_HEAT (5) - so no compartment is born already qualifying for
 * a crack. An earlier draft of this scene used an asymmetric range that
 * reached down to 0 and 1, and it was a real dead end: those rings
 * shattered on step 1, through whichever shock direction their family was
 * NOT meant to be exercising, before the outside trigger had ramped
 * anything at all - the scene was testing its own setup rather than the
 * mechanism. Starting strictly inside the gap is also the stagger lever:
 * step_one_cold_cell() moves a pane one level per successful roll, so a
 * ring at 2 is one chill from the cold threshold and a ring at 4 is
 * three - and the same distances the other way round for the climb to
 * SAND_SHOCK_HEAT - so the 480 compartments do not all cross at once
 * even though they are all built from the same two triggers.
 *
 * WHY THE COMPARTMENTS ARE SEPARATED: each ring is 20 cells, far under
 * crack_run()'s CRACK_MAX of 256, and what keeps one shock from reaching
 * a neighbouring compartment's glass at all is the tile's own layout, not
 * the grid's leftover margin: lx 0 and ly 0-1 are left empty and the
 * trigger takes lx 1, lx 8 and ly 8, so the nearest glass in the next
 * tile is three cells away with a trigger and empty space in between.
 * (The four spare columns and eight spare rows - 20x9 is 180 of 184 and
 * 24x9 is 216 of 224 - are unused margin along the right and bottom
 * edges, and separate nothing.) See test_a_crack_does_not_jump_to_a_-
 * separate_pane, which is the same guarantee this scene leans on at 480x
 * the scale.
 *
 * WHY LAVA IS A PAYLOAD AND NEVER A TRIGGER: lava is a liquid, and an
 * outside trigger sits in a bare one-cell-wide U with nothing under it
 * from below the grid - a liquid there would simply drain away before it
 * ever got to test anything. The two outside triggers are instead the
 * materials that hold still on their own: burning wood (KIND_STATIC) and
 * ice (KIND_STATIC). Lava only ever appears as a payload, sitting inside
 * a box that can actually hold it. This is a deliberate departure from
 * the original sketch for this scene, which asked for lava as an outside
 * trigger too - it does not survive contact with how liquids move.
 *
 * WHAT THE FAMILY SPLIT DOES AND DOES NOT DO: the left ten columns
 * (family C) pair a burning-wood trigger with a cold payload - ice or
 * snow - so they are BUILT to favour the cold-onto-hot direction, and the
 * right ten columns (family H) pair an ice trigger with a hot payload -
 * wood or lava - to favour hot-onto-cold. MEASURED, the split is not
 * pure: family C's own cold payload chills its ring past SAND_SHOCK_COLD
 * from the inside, so hot-onto-cold fires there too, and family H's own
 * hot payload pushes its ring past SAND_SHOCK_HEAT from the inside, so
 * cold-onto-hot fires there as well. Both directions run in both halves
 * from step 1. The split earns its place as the payload/trigger MATRIX -
 * four combinations of {cold, hot} outside x {cold, hot} inside, laid out
 * so every compartment has an outside push and an inside push in the same
 * or opposite sense - not as proof that either half exercises only one
 * direction. What actually proves each direction fires is the pair of
 * counters in the host test below, which look at the mechanism's own
 * precondition directly rather than trusting the geometry to imply it.
 *
 * What this measures that nothing else in this file does: heat_ramp
 * climbing through hundreds of independent panes at once, in-glass
 * conduction along each ring, crack_run() firing under sustained load
 * instead of once, and the mixed aftermath of that all at once -
 * meltwater, steam, escaping fire and falling cullet sharing the same
 * screen.
 *
 * Runs at the app's own per-material scatter, decay and mobility, the
 * same choice build_lava_stress_scene() makes above and for the same
 * reason: app_sand.c does too. */

/* The two shock directions - cold arriving at hot glass in
 * step_one_cold_cell(), heat arriving at cold glass in try_heat_-
 * transform() - are different code paths that can break independently
 * and have (see test_heat_arriving_at_frosted_glass_cracks_it, which
 * exists for exactly that reason). This scene claims to exercise both at
 * once across the whole lattice, and the two counters below check that
 * claim directly rather than trusting the payload/trigger matrix to
 * imply it - see build_thermal_shock_scene()'s comment for why the
 * matrix alone is not that proof.
 *
 * d1_ready counts MAT_GLASS cells at variant >= SAND_SHOCK_HEAT with a
 * cardinal neighbour whose reaction_of() has chills != 0 - exactly
 * step_one_cold_cell()'s shock precondition, which takes no roll once it
 * holds. d2_ready is its mirror: MAT_GLASS cells at variant <=
 * SAND_SHOCK_COLD with a cardinal neighbour that cell_is_burning(), which
 * is try_heat_transform()'s precondition, also roll-free. Roll-free is
 * the whole reason to count preconditions rather than cracks: a standing
 * precondition is a fact about the board, not a probability, so a
 * non-zero count is real evidence that direction is live. It is not quite
 * a promise that those exact panes break next step - the movement passes
 * run first, and a drift or a melting block can leave the pane before the
 * reactions pass reaches it - which is why the assertions below grade
 * these on HOW MANY STEPS the precondition stands, not on a count.
 *
 * Both are counted after every one of the 10 measured steps, because the
 * claim is that each direction keeps firing across the window, not just
 * once at the start.
 *
 * WHY TEN STEPS, AND WHY THIRDS OF (step - 1) / 3: the window is graded
 * by charging each step's new cullet to one third of it - steps 1-3, 4-6,
 * 7-10 - and ten is the shortest window where the LAST third still earns
 * a real share of the total. Measured, ten steps split 54.1 / 28.9 /
 * 17.0 percent; twelve, fifteen and twenty all push the tail under 15 as
 * the early cracking dominates more and more of the run (11.8, 11.5 and
 * 13.6 percent), and eight steps split honestly into thirds leaves the
 * last one at 11.0. The divisor and the step count are one decision:
 * change the window without changing /3 and the buckets stop being
 * thirds at all, which is exactly how an earlier draft came to grade a
 * 2/2/4 split as if it were 3/3/4.
 *
 * The cullet tally needs a STICKY mask - a cell that was ever cullet,
 * tracked separately from what is cullet right now - and that is a real
 * finding rather than a stylistic choice. Cullet is MAT_SAND at a variant
 * SAND_CULLET_BASE or higher, and it is not inert: sand.heats_to is
 * MAT_GLASS, so a fallen shard sitting near a hot payload can re-fuse
 * into glass and later crack again. A naive per-step delta on a live
 * MAT_SAND count goes negative the moment that happens, undercounting
 * exactly the churn this scene exists to show. The sticky mask only ever
 * grows, so "new cullet this third" stays a meaningful, non-negative
 * quantity even while individual cells are cycling glass -> cullet ->
 * glass under the payload's heat.
 *
 * The mask is a BITSET, not a byte per cell. This is the only test in
 * the file that needs a second full-grid buffer alongside `big`, and the
 * device has only about 68 KB of heap left once the display framebuffer
 * is carved out of it - two 41,216-byte grids do not fit in that, one
 * byte per cell does. The first device run of this test with a byte mask
 * failed AND leaked 41,240 bytes for the rest of boot, because the null
 * check on the third malloc aborted the test before the frees at its end
 * ever ran. One bit per cell brings the mask down to 5,152 bytes, which
 * fits comfortably. */

/* The boiler from test_the_boiler_end_to_end, scaled from one column to
 * the whole 184x224 grid and run as a SUSTAINED STEADY STATE rather than
 * a transient - the opposite of build_thermal_shock_scene() above,
 * deliberately, so the pair covers both shapes of thermal load this
 * simulation has to handle: a burst of damage that runs its course, and
 * a heat source left running that has to keep producing without either
 * exhausting its fuel or its water.
 *
 * The slab is 11 rows thick, the pour brush's real thickness - the same
 * figure test_the_boiler_end_to_end uses, and for the same reason.
 * conduct_heat() attenuates at roughly 0.86 per cell of depth it has to
 * cross, so slab thickness is the THROTTLE on how fast the basin can
 * boil: eleven rows is what keeps the rate sustainable across the whole
 * measured window instead of exhausting the basin partway through it.
 *
 * TWO BURNERS ON PURPOSE: lava never decays, so it is the steady heat
 * source; wood burns down (burn_decay 24) and is there so the OTHER heat
 * source path - an ember rather than a permanent liquid - is covered by
 * the same scene instead of needing a second one. Measured, all 356 wood
 * cells painted are still lit at the end of the window, and both halves
 * of the basin boil at close to the same rate - see the host test's
 * per-half assertions.
 *
 * WHY THE BOILING RATE IS SELF-SUSTAINING: steam made at the slab is
 * lighter than the water sitting above it, so try_bubble() (sand_gas.c)
 * swaps it upward one cell at a time and water falls back down onto the
 * slab to be boiled in its turn. The basin keeps refilling its own hot
 * face on its own; no extra geometry - chutes, gaps, anything - is
 * needed to make that happen, unlike build_lava_stress_scene() above,
 * which needs its chute for exactly this reason.
 *
 * WHY THE BURNER IS FULLY ENCLOSED (stone side walls the full depth of
 * the basin, a stone slab, the grid floor underneath): so that flare has
 * almost nowhere to put fresh fire, and the cell count therefore says
 * something about the boil rather than about how much empty space
 * happened to be lying around.
 *
 * "Almost" is the honest word, and it is why the host test below asserts
 * a FLOOR on the count rather than an equality. Measured: the count sits
 * exactly at its window-start value for the first twenty steps of the
 * measured window and then starts climbing, reaching 8293 from 8280 by
 * the end of it - the boil has by then opened enough gaps in the water
 * above the slab for flare to reach them. An equality would simply fail
 * here - and it is worth knowing that it held for the shorter settle an
 * earlier draft of this scene used only by a SINGLE step: total step 41
 * is where the count first moves, and that draft stopped at 40. That is
 * not a margin worth building an assertion on. */

/* Sand and dirt poured in equal amounts, then water dropped over both until
 * it settles - the first benchmark in this file to exercise the wet-earth
 * path at all. Sand slowly BECOMES dirt (material.c's MAT_SAND row:
 * `.soaks = 8, .soaks_to = MAT_DIRT`) while the dirt it becomes goes on
 * drinking, far faster (MAT_DIRT: `.soaks = 60`) and only slowly gives that
 * moisture back up (`.dries = 2`, a thirtieth of its own soak rate). A wet
 * dirt cell's variant IS the moisture level while it is wet (material.h's
 * CELL_MOISTURE()/SOIL_MOISTURE_MAX, 0 dry to 7 saturated; the same nibble
 * reads as a dry TONE once it is not, which is what pays for the shading
 * this scene never looks at) - so this scene's own composition keeps
 * changing while it runs: the sand/dirt split at the end is not the split
 * it was poured with.
 *
 * REACTION DISPATCH UNDER SUSTAINED LOAD is the thing this scene exists to
 * measure, not just liquid movement, and getting that to actually happen
 * turned out to be less obvious than it sounds. sand_step_reactions()
 * (sand_reactions.c) gates its whole pass behind six content flags and
 * clears each one the moment a pass finds nothing for it to do; a flag is
 * re-armed only by a cell WRITE (sand_priv.h's latch_content_flags(),
 * called from sand_set() and from a handful of reaction outcomes) - NEVER
 * by ordinary liquid movement in sand_liquid.c. A board of nothing but
 * water arms may_have_moisture once, at paint time, because water is
 * KIND_LIQUID - and the very first reactions pass clears it straight back
 * off, since nothing wet is touching anything that soaks. Nothing in
 * plain liquid movement ever re-arms it after that. Dirt is what breaks
 * the silence: a soil cell holding any MOISTURE keeps re-arming the flag
 * on every write that touches it (sand_priv.h: `r->dries != 0 &&
 * CELL_MOISTURE(cell) != 0`), so once this scene is wet, the reactions
 * pass keeps running every step for as long as any dirt anywhere is damp
 * - which, measured, is the whole window below. CELL_MOISTURE(), not the
 * raw variant this comment used to name: a DRY cell's variant is a tone,
 * and testing the whole nibble latched this for seven of every eight dry
 * cells for good, whether or not anything on the board was ever wet -
 * fixed alongside the re-encoding that gave dry soil those eight tones in
 * the first place (see material.h's own comment on soil's state split).
 *
 * EQUAL, AND MIXED DOWN TO ONE CELL. Sand and dirt are painted as a
 * single-cell checkerboard - material = (x + y) & 1 - rather than as two
 * stacked halves or even column-wide stripes, so the water above meets
 * both in exactly the same proportion at every column and every depth it
 * reaches, instead of one material happening to sit nearer the surface
 * and racing the other's soak rate by geometry rather than by the
 * materials' own numbers. Fully packed, no gaps, so the bed is exactly as
 * stable a floor as the other builders' solid blocks above - 12,420 cells
 * of each, verified by the host test below.
 *
 * WHY THE WATER IS PAINTED RESTING DIRECTLY ON THE EARTH, WITH NO GAP.
 * The obvious way to write "drop water over them" is to leave headroom
 * above the bed and let it fall - and an early draft of this scene did
 * exactly that, with a ten-row gap between the water and the earth's
 * surface. It measured nothing at all: see the may_have_moisture
 * reasoning above - the flag is armed once, at paint time, and with a
 * gap to fall through first it is cleared again by the very first
 * reactions pass, ten-odd steps before the water actually reaches the
 * earth, and nothing in ordinary liquid movement ever re-arms it after
 * that. Four hundred steps of that draft produced not one wet dirt cell.
 * Painting the water already flush against the earth's surface keeps
 * real contact present from step one, while the flag is still armed from
 * painting it, so the very first reactions pass finds moisture and keeps
 * the flag alive for the ones that follow.
 *
 * NOT A FULL-WIDTH SLAB, EITHER. A slab already spanning the whole 184
 * columns at a uniform depth is already at rest - flat on a flat floor,
 * with nothing for gravity or the liquid's own mass-diffusion to do -
 * which would leave nothing for "until the water settles" to describe.
 * Painted instead over the CENTER HALF of the width only (x in [46,
 * 138)), it has to spread sideways to reach the flanks, which is the
 * active settling this benchmark is named for: measured (three seeds),
 * the water first touches earth across the full 184-column width
 * somewhere between step 30 and step 31, having started touching only
 * the center 92 columns.
 *
 * ENOUGH TO PERCOLATE, NOT JUST WET A CRUST. Percolation depth - the
 * deepest row below the earth's surface holding any dirt moisture at all
 * - reaches row 13 by the time the water has finished spreading (step
 * 35, the settle allowance below) and keeps climbing through the whole
 * measured window, to row 17-22 by step 65 (measured, three seeds). The
 * earth bed is 135 rows deep, so this is a front still advancing into a
 * bed nowhere near saturated, not a shallow soak that stalls at the
 * surface.
 *
 * sand_set_soak() is OFF by default, unlike scatter, decay and mobility -
 * see its own comment in sand.h: "half the tests in the suite put sand in
 * water to check that sand SINKS", and a mechanic that arrived switched
 * on would have rewritten every one of them. None of the other builders
 * in this section call it, because none of them need to; this one does,
 * and is the only one that does. Left off, this whole scene would
 * silently measure nothing but liquid movement. Runs at
 * SAND_SOAK_PER_MATERIAL alongside the app's own scatter, decay and
 * mobility settings - app_sand.c calls all four. */

 *
 * 35 SETTLE STEPS, not the 20-30 the boiler and lava stress scenes use.
 * The number here is not a "let it get going" allowance in the usual
 * sense - it is chosen against the one concrete milestone
 * build_wet_earth_scene()'s comment names: full-width contact, which
 * measured (three seeds) lands at step 30 for one seed and step 31 for
 * the other two. 35 is that milestone plus a margin, not a round number

 * milestone directly (touching every column) rather than trusting the
 * step count alone to have reached it, for the same reason the mixed
 * scene's own coverage test above does not trust geometry to imply
 * contact either.
 *
 * Unlike the boiler or the thermal shock lattice, this scene has no tail
 * to avoid measuring past - watched out to 1200 steps on the host (40x
 * this benchmark's own window), water mass keeps falling and dirt keeps
 * gaining at close to the same rate the whole way, because the earth bed
 * is 135 rows deep and nowhere near saturated by the time any budget this
 * suite can afford would stop. The only transient here is the SPREADING
 * one the settle allowance exists to clear - once the water has reached
 * every column, the scene does not go quiet again within any window this
 * file has time to run.
 *
 * FOUR CHECKPOINTS across the 30 measured steps - at +7, +15, +22 and +30,
 * the same spacing test_the_boiler_scene_keeps_boiling_across_the_window
 * uses for the same reason: a single before/after comparison cannot catch
 * a scene that is active at first and stalls partway through. Measured
 * (three seeds, water mass lost per quarter): 274-373 units, comfortably
 * clear of the 150 floor below; moisture gained per quarter: 190-271
 * against a floor of 100. Both floors sit at roughly half the worst-case
 * measured value, the same margin the rest of this file's coverage
 * assertions use.
 *
 * DIRT GAINED PER QUARTER moved when PART 2 of the roots-and-percolation
 * change split percolation out of `spread` into its own, deliberately
 * slower SOIL_PERCOLATE_CHANCE (sand_reactions.c) - sand converting to
 * dirt BELOW a wet cell is exactly the branch that constant now governs,
 * and lateral diffusion (still at the old, unchanged rate) only ever
 * carried part of this scene's total. Re-measured on this scene's own
 * fixed seed (53u - not the three the water-mass and moisture figures
 * above were originally taken across): 48, 51, 31, 54 per quarter. Still
 * nonzero every quarter - conversion has not stalled, it is simply
 * slower, which is the entire point of PART 2 - so the honest fix is a
 * lower floor, not a faster constant that would undo the change this test
 * exists to guard downstream of. 20, at the same roughly-half-of-worst-
 * case margin the other two floors use against the new worst quarter
 * (31), rather than left at the old 50 to keep this scene "passing"

/* HOW FAR PAST THE DUNE'S OWN EDGE, not how far from an arbitrary point

 * searching outward from (x, y) in expanding square rings - the same
 * eight-directions-at-once shape ring_dir() in sand_priv.h moves grains
 * in - checking only each ring's own perimeter against `footprint` until
 * one of its bits is set. That is a Chebyshev (8-connected) distance
 * transform, the exact same value a multi-source breadth-first flood
 * fill seeded from every footprint cell would compute for this one cell -
 * two ways of answering the identical question, not two different
 * questions - so switching to it changes nothing about WHAT a grain that
 * merely slid down the dune's own slope reads as versus one genuinely
 * thrown clear (see this file's own top-of-section comment for why that
 * distinction is the entire point).
 *
 * WHY NOT THE FLOOD FILL THIS REPLACED: it answered the question for
 * every one of the grid's 41,216 cells whether or not anything downstream
 * ever asked, which needed `dist` and `queue`, REAL_W*REAL_H ints each -
 * 164,864 bytes apiece, 329,728 together. This scene only ever asks for
 * the handful of cells that turn out to be outside the settled footprint
 * after a blast - 105 of them in a measured run, against the 41,216 the
 * flood fill priced itself for regardless. A bounded RECTANGLE around the
 * footprint - the fix this section's dune scene otherwise follows for
 * `footprint` itself, just scoped down instead of reshaped - could not
 * replace it either: this scene's own settled dune measured 127 cells
 * wide (69% of the grid's own 184-cell width, a wide, short pile rather
 * than a tall narrow one), and even a ZERO-margin box exactly matching
 * that footprint's bounding rectangle costs 24,003 bytes at the smallest
 * correct per-cell types (a 1-byte Chebyshev distance, a 2-byte queue
 * slot - see this file's own commit message for both derivations) against
 * roughly 7,952 bytes left once `big`, `blocks`, `impulses` and the
 * footprint bitset above are accounted for. A per-query outward search
 * has no rectangle to fit into at all: its cost is proportional to how
 * FAR a query cell sits from the nearest footprint cell, not to the
 * footprint's own size, so this pile's actual queries - every one of them
 * resolving within two or three rings, measured - stay cheap regardless
 * of how wide the pile itself gets, and it needs no storage beyond this
 * function's own local variables.
 *
 * `cap` bounds the search so a genuinely pathological grid still
 * terminates - callers pass the largest Chebyshev distance any two cells
 * on this grid could possibly have, (max(REAL_W, REAL_H) - 1) = 223, so
 * the cap can never itself produce a wrong answer for a cell this grid
 * actually contains; it only bounds the search, the same role CRACK_MAX
 * plays for crack_run() in sand_reactions.c, not a correctness knob. */

 * BROKE THE FEATURE OUTRIGHT on real hardware, TWICE, for two different
 * reasons caught by two different device flashes. First: the impulse
 * buffer used to be sized FROM this radius
 * (`(355*r*r)/113 + 5*r + 3` entries), so doubling it demanded a ~43.8 KB
 * allocation nothing on this board could satisfy. Second, after that got
 * fixed by decoupling buffer size from radius (see below) and sizing the
 * fixed budget against a ~76 KB TOTAL free-heap boot-log figure instead:
 * a live serial capture at that "fixed" budget still failed, showing
 * `heap_caps_get_largest_free_block()` stuck at an identical 14,592
 * bytes across three different quality settings - proof the relevant
 * number was never total free heap at all, but the single largest
 * contiguous run, which can be far smaller than the sum of everything
 * technically free. Neither failure was visible to this test's fixed RNG
 * seed and unlimited host `malloc()` - nothing here ever fails to
 * allocate, which is exactly why this bug needed a device twice to be
 * believed. See SAND_IMPULSE_BUDGET_BYTES's own comment in app_sand.c
 * for the full arithmetic of both incidents.
 *
 * NEITHER FIX WAS A SMALLER RADIUS. Both were decoupling buffer size
 * from radius entirely: APP_IMPULSE_MAX (app_sand.c) is now a FIXED
 * entry count chosen once from the device's own heap budget - now
 * against the observed largest-contiguous-block number, not total free
 * heap - and sand_explode() itself (sand.c) now THINS its own seeding
 * density automatically whenever a disc's true cell count would exceed
 * whatever buffer it was actually given - evenly, across the whole disc,
 * rather than truncating its shape - see queue_outward_impulse()'s own
 * comment in sand.c. That decoupling is what let the radius become a
 * genuinely free choice again - which is exactly what it became next:
 * a real device confirmed 96 px allocating and detonating without a
 * crash, at a visibly thinned density, and the user chose to trade that
 * size back down for a SMALLER radius at FULL density instead, on the
 * actual measured numbers (see DETONATE_RADIUS_PX's own comment in
 * app_sand.c for the full account and the "why 25 cells, not a round
 * number" derivation). This constant follows DETONATE_RADIUS_PX's own
 * value rather than drifting from it, same as before - the point of the
 * fix was never that the radius COULDN'T shrink, only that it no longer
 * HAD to just to keep the buffer allocating. */

     * blast never empties that centre (queue_outward_impulse() skips it by

     * occupied cells, so occupancy is conserved and no hole is opened
     * anywhere. Measured: with move_liquid_grain() stubbed to return false,
     * so liquids cannot move AT ALL, this test still passed.
     *
     * So the cavity is carved directly rather than hoped for from the
     * blast, and the assertion asks for WATER back, not merely for
     * something. Measured over 113 carved cells: 89 refill normally, 32
     * with liquids immobile; half the carved count sits between them with
     * roughly 50% margin either way. Disabling cross-flow levelling instead
     * refills 113 and passes, correctly - water falling vertically is a
     * different mechanism, and test_a_pool_settles_at_the_angle_it_is_
     * tilted_to is the test that dies when cross-flow does.
     *

     * above still measures the blast alone. */

 * covered lava converting to stone and bursting (bd esp32c6-mqt) - has no
 * mechanism left anywhere near as expensive as the vent scan this scene
 * used to hold open: one roll per covered lava cell per step, at odds of
 * roughly 1 in 256, with a 3-neighbour cover_mask() walk only after the
 * roll passes. A "burst spam" scene built the same way (many cells
 * forced-covered, chance pinned to maximum) would measure a real cost,
 * but not a REPRESENTATIVE one - production never pins the chance, and
 * the walk it is paying for is cheap. This scene instead measures the
 * ordinary, sustained thing a player actually does: pour water onto
 * lava. That single act chains through three separate reactions -
 * quench (direct water-lava contact converting to stone),
 * cool_off_chain() (that conversion's own cost paid outward into
 * neighbouring lava, sand_reactions.c), and the burst gate (once enough
 * of a stone crust has formed over what's left) - so a regression in any
 * of the three shows up here, not only in its own narrower correctness
 * test.
 *
 * DO NOT compare this row's numbers against the old vent-spam capture
 * that used to sit here. This is a different scene measuring a different
 * mechanism; the old figure describes a machinery that no longer exists,
 * not a slower or faster version of what replaced it. See test_the_
 * water_over_lava_scene_fits_in_the_frame_budget's own comment (below,
 * beside the other frame-budget tests) for the first-capture convention
 * this file already has for exactly this situation. */

 * needs to stay sealed: quench and cool_off_chain() only need lava

 * to form, which a wide, deep pool supplies on its own as the interface
 * quenches. A single seam this wide puts as many lava cells in
 * simultaneous contact with water as the grid can hold, which is the

 * 16,998 us of raw blit against 18,147 us of full gfx_present()) rather
 * than the measured number, because
 * it had already been raised twice from over-tight measured budgets - see
 * git history. It also carries a documented cross-build risk: the same code
 * has measured a 3.2-3.9 ms swing purely from the ESP32-C6's 32 KB flash
 * cache aligning differently as unrelated code shifts layout.
 *
 * Tightened anyway, past even the ~10% headroom this file's other
 * budgets use, to 6000 - about 3.3% over the real measured 5802 us,
 * exactly reproducible across fresh captures on the current build (fixed
 * RNG seed - see docs/Sand/Architecture.md's "Verifying performance on
 * real hardware"). That thin a margin is a real bet against the
 * documented flash-cache swing above: if a future rebuild reintroduces
 * it and this starts flaking, that is the known, accepted trade-off of
 * tightening this far past the old principle-based number - loosen it
 * again rather than treating one flaky run as a simulation regression.
 *
 * Previously shared with the settled-pile flip test below via one
 * STEP_BUDGET_US constant; split into its own name once the two

 * and there was never a real reason to hold them to the same ceiling.
 *
 * THE 2026-08-26 RE-BASE, which this and every other frame budget in
 * this file now follows: after the materials wave, the first full
 * capture of the current tree (performance_20260826_150930, reproduced
 * by a second capture to within 4 us on every test) re-measured all
 * thirteen scenes, and every budget was re-set to a UNIFORM REDUCTION
 * TARGET of measured * 0.9, rounded - a deliberate decision to demand
 * 10% improvement across the whole board rather than ratchet any
 * budget up to what the code happens to cost today. Every number
 * stays BELOW its own measured value, so nothing passes by decree;
 * all thirteen fail on the day of the re-base, and each stops failing
 * only when the work is done. Some numbers moved numerically upward
 * from older budgets (water, the fire pair, the every-material flip) -
 * those older budgets were reduction targets pegged to baselines that
 * predate the materials wave, and holding them frozen while the
 * simulation gained temperature, viscosity, drag, percolation and five
 * new scenes would conflate "the feature costs something" with "the
 * code regressed". The measured number beside each assertion is the
 * anchor; the target is a tenth under it.

/* THE USER'S OWN SCENARIO, AS A FRAME BUDGET - the same turn test_turning_a_

 * timed instead. Filed because the device report was not only "a flip of
 * colours": the other half of it was "tilt flips into straight positions
 * with the water settled seem to cause a huge spike".
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT test_flipping_gravity_on_a_settled_pile_fits_in_the_frame_
 * budget ABOVE, which already times a flip on a settled body. It differs in
 * every dimension that decides the cost:
 *
 *   - WATER, NOT SAND. A liquid grain goes through move_liquid_grain() and
 *     the mass-diffusion cross-flow pass, which the water budget above is
 *     more than twice the sand one precisely because of.
 *   - 40% OF THE GRID, full width, against that test's middle-half-width
 *     block from half height - about 25%, and never touching the side walls.
 *   - A 90-DEGREE ROTATION, not a 180-degree reversal. For a liquid that is
 *     the harder case by a long way: reversing gravity mostly drops the body
 *     in place, while turning the board sideways makes the whole pool
 *     re-level ACROSS the full grid width, which is exactly what the
 *     cross-flow search costs the most for. It also crosses the depth walk's
 *     own 45-degree regime line and flips both scan-direction flags, so it
 *     exercises the render side and not only the simulation.
 *
 * THE TURN IS SWEPT, one step per degree of it, rather than stepped in one
 * jump: a real tilt filter ramps, and the expensive frames are the ones
 * where the pool is mid-re-level, not the single frame the vector changes
 * on. Gravity follows a chord from (0, G) to (G, 0) so this needs no
 * trigonometry, the same reason the other tilt scenes here use straight
 * lines and triangle waves.
 *
 * BOTH THE MEAN AND THE WORST SINGLE STEP ARE LOGGED, and deliberately so:
 * a rotation's cost is not flat across the sweep, and a mean alone is
 * exactly the shape of number that can hide a spike - which is what the
 * report was about. The budget is asserted on the mean, matching every other
 * scene here; the worst is there to read in the capture. */

     * THE 60091 IS STALE, AND KNOWINGLY SO. It was taken on 2026-08-25
     * against a scene of TWELVE materials covering 66 pairs. There are
     * fourteen now - glass and snow - so the same derived scene covers 91
     * pairs, and the reactions pass has gained a per-cell branch and a
     * second kind of participant (cells with a temperature) since. The
     * scene this number describes no longer exists.
     *
     * The number is deliberately NOT adjusted for that. A reduction target
     * moved to accommodate the code is no longer a target, and this file
     * has already been burned twice by figures that were reasoned about
     * rather than measured - 100000 picked with no hardware, then 300000
     * extrapolated from another scene's ratio, which came out four times
     * too pessimistic. The right correction is a fresh device capture, not
     * an estimate.
     *
     * On the extrapolation that produced 300000: fire measures ~318x host
     * and this scene ~63x, so it predicted 226-244 ms against an actual
     * 60 ms. Worth remembering before anyone extrapolates again - on this
     * chip the ratio is dominated by cache behaviour the host does not
     * model, and it is scene-specific.
     *
     * The staleness warning the paragraphs above carried is RESOLVED:
     * the fresh capture the 2026-08-26 re-base ran on (see
     * FULL_STEP_BUDGET_US's comment) measured the fourteen-material
     * scene at 74911 us, and the target followed the same uniform rule
     * as every other budget: measured * 0.9, rounded -> 67500.

 * watchdog was turned off): the fifteenth attempt proved the 106650
 * was contaminated - a watchdog register dump's console I/O landed
 * inside this test's timing window and was charged to the simulation,
 * and here the dump was worth fully ~7900 us of the old number. Clean
 * measurement 98738 -> target 89000.
 *
 * The watchdog reasoning here is stronger than it was for the three
 * scenes above: ten steps, and no settling step to spend any of the
 * window on first. Host timing, best-of-5 and interleaved with the other
 * four scenes so nothing is measured while the machine is still warming
 * up, ranks this scene the most expensive of the five - 1199 us/step
 * against 824 for the lava stress scene, 763 for four liquids reacting,
 * 647 for the smoke-and-steam screen and 218 for the boiler. That host
 * number is a RELATIVE signal only, telling us this scene costs more
 * than its siblings on the same machine - it is deliberately NOT
 * extrapolated to a device figure, for the reason given above, and the
 * absolute figures are worth little in any case: host wall-clock on this
 * project drifts up to 40% within a single harness run, which is why
 * they are taken best-of-N with the builds interleaved.
 *
 * The step count is not chosen against those numbers at all. It is fixed
 * at ten by the host guard beside this test - see that test's comment on
 * why the cullet timeline only splits into honest thirds at ten - and
 * the CEILING is then what gets chosen against the watchdog: at the
 * original provisional 400000, ten steps was four seconds against the
 * device's five-second task watchdog; at the re-based 96000 the margin
 * is wide. The two remain one decision - raise the step count without
 * minding the ceiling and the bet needs re-doing. */

/* --- gfx_present() cost against real sand scenes ------------------------
 *
 * Every frame-budget test above times sand_step() alone, with no drawing at
 * all involved - nobody has ever measured what gfx_present() actually costs
 * against the dirty pattern a busy, real sand scene leaves behind (see
 * suite_gfx.c for the only present() numbers that exist, all from synthetic
 * marks a test wrote by hand). The tests below close that gap, by building a
 * real scene, stepping it, reproducing app_sand.c's OWN marking policy
 * against the result, and timing gfx_present() on what that produces.
 *
 * "Reproducing", not calling: app_sand.c's draw_dirty_rows(), draw_one_row()
 * and paint_row() are all static, relying on the compiler inlining them
 * into their one call site. Removing `static` from a hot per-call
 * function to share it across a translation-unit boundary is the exact
 * shape of change a previous tuning round measured a 26% regression from
 * - not these functions, but try_fall_or_scatter()/try_slide() in sand.c -
 * see the seventh attempt in docs/Sand/Performance-Tuning-Attempts.md, and
 * the eighth for how long it took to notice a "fix" for it was aimed at
 * code the failing benchmark never even ran. So
 * mirror_app_sand_marking() below duplicates the ~15 lines of policy from
 * draw_dirty_rows()'s `for (int cy...)` loop (app_sand.c, around its own
 * line 884) instead: the same row_runs_find()/row_runs_span_fallback()/
 * row_runs_reconcile() calls, in the same order, gated by the same per-row
 * dirty flag sand_track_dirty_rows() maintains. It does not paint any
 * pixels - gfx_present()'s cost depends only on which regions were marked
 * dirty, never on their colour, and paint_row()/draw_one_row() are the
 * static functions that decide colour, exactly the ones this cannot call
 * without repeating the regression above. */

/* THE ACTUAL BUG A REAL DEVICE HIT, reported after acid_bubble() first
 * shipped living in move_liquid_grain() (sand_liquid.c): a real, calm
 * puddle of acid on device never bubbled at all, though the exact same
 * mechanism visibly worked in the test above. The difference is
 * sand_enable_sleeping() (see app_sand.c, which does enable it with a
 * real buffer) - move_liquid_grain() only runs for cells the MAIN SWEEP
 * visits, and step_one_row() (sand.c) skips any block marked settled
 * under block-sleeping entirely, never calling move_liquid_grain() for
 * its cells at all. A calm, undisturbed puddle earns that settled mark
 * within a handful of quiet steps - which is exactly what "calm" means -
 * so the trigger stopped firing the moment the puddle stopped visibly
 * moving, precisely when bubbling was supposed to prove it was still
 * "alive". The test above never caught this because it never enables
 * sleeping, so it always visits every cell regardless of settled state -
 * a blind spot in the test, not evidence the mechanism worked on device.
 *
 * FIXED by moving acid_bubble() into sand_reactions.c, called from
 * step_one_reacting_row()'s own `r->dissolves` branch - that pass is not
 * gated by block-sleeping at all (see acid_bubble()'s own comment there),
 * for the same reason dissolving and cooling already were not: they have
 * to keep happening on a board with nothing else moving.
 *
 * THIS TEST is the one that would have caught it: same flat pool as
 * above, but with sand_enable_sleeping() on, and a quiet settle period
 * BEFORE the check loop starts, so the pool's own block is genuinely
 * asleep (confirmed via sand_block_settled(), not merely assumed) before
 * a single bubble is allowed to count. */
