 * sand_priv - internals shared between sand.c and sand_liquid.c.
 *
 * Not a public header: nothing outside this module includes it, and nothing
 * in it is part of sand.h's API. It exists only because splitting the liquid
 * logic into its own file left a few things - marking a row dirty, finding
 * the row a move would land in - needed on both sides of that split.
 *
 * dest_row() and mark_rows() stay `static inline` here rather than becoming
 * ordinary functions defined once and declared extern: both sit on the
 * hottest path in the simulation - called per row, and per move,
 * respectively - and a call across translation units is not guaranteed to
 * inline the way a call within the same file is. A header of small inline
 * functions gives each .c file its own inlinable copy, which is what lets the
 * file split without also risking a performance regression for it - see the
 * frame-budget tests in suite_sand.c, which is exactly what would catch it if
 * this ever stopped being true.
